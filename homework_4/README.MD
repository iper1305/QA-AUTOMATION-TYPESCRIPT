# JS Functions and Objects Practice

This project contains a series of tasks designed to practice JavaScript fundamentals, focusing on functions, arrow functions, and working with objects. It covers basic operations, object manipulation, and the usage of getter and setter methods in JavaScript.

## Project Structure

- `functions.js`: Contains a function that performs arithmetic addition on an array of numbers. It demonstrates basic function syntax and array manipulation.
- `arrow-functions.js`: Implements the same functionality as `functions.js` but using an arrow function to showcase an alternative syntax.
- `getter-setters.js`: Features an object with at least two levels, including getters and setters. Additionally, it includes a function that manipulates the object's fields and returns the result.

## Tasks

### 1. **functions.js**
Create a function that accepts an array and performs arithmetic addition on its elements, returning the result of the operation. The function is then tested with two arrays (one of strings and one of numbers).

### 2. **arrow-functions.js**
Rewrite the function from `functions.js` using an arrow function syntax. This demonstrates the difference in syntax between regular functions and arrow functions in JavaScript.

### 3. **getter-setters.js**
Create a multi-level object that includes both getters and setters. Implement a method that manipulates the object fields and returns the result.
